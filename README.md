# sql-to-class
Converter to turn sql tables into Python classes  

This script runs over all .sql files in the designated folder, and translated them to Python classes.  
It will also generate a repository script for each field in the database.  
These repository classes are used to connect to the database, and are constructed to disable SQL injection.
