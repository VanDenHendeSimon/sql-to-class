# sql-to-class
Script to turn MySQL tables into Python classes that mirror the table exactly, as well as generating repository classes.  

This script runs over all .sql files in the designated folder, and translates them to Python classes.  
It will also generate a repository class for each field in the database.  
These repository classes are used to connect to the database, and are constructed to disable SQL injection.
    
The classes generated by the script are included in the repo as well to give you an example of the code that is produced.
